### Hi there 👋

Looking for a job or internship as a Frontend Developer.

In September 2022, I decided to retrain in IT. Before that, I worked as a digital marketer, building business processes to generate traffic to websites and receive targeted user actions (requests, registrations, purchases).

In the course of my work, I was in constant communication with developers, supervised the production of sites, translated customer requirements into tasks. I wanted to become a developer myself. As a result, I chose the direction and now I am studying as a Frontend developer at Hexlet.

- [Difference Calculator](https://github.com/domingi/frontend-project-46) - CLI utility that determines the difference between two data structures with the possibility of three types of output to the console;
- [Mind Games](https://github.com/domingi/frontend-project-44) - a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for pumping the brain.
