## Hi there 👋

### Web developer
Looking for a job or internship as a Frontend Developer.

In September 2022, I decided to retrain in IT. Before that, I worked as a digital marketer, building business processes to generate traffic to websites and receive targeted user actions (requests, registrations, purchases).

In the course of my work, I was in constant communication with developers, supervised the production of sites, translated customer requirements into tasks. I wanted to become a developer myself. As a result, I choose the direction and finished studying as a Frontend developer at Hexlet.

- [RSS Aggregator](https://github.com/domingi/rss-aggregator) - a service for aggregating RSS feeds. Add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them itself and adds new entries to the general feed;
